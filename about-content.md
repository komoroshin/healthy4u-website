### Структура:
- Заголовок
- 3 параграфа истории создания
- Групповое фото основателей

### Контент:

**Заголовок:**
- "How it all started."

**Параграфы:**

Параграф 1:
- "It all started with a simple but profound desire—to create something that truly helps people and to leave a legacy that isn't measured just in money. Two years ago, while on a business trip in Cannes, sitting with colleagues over coffee, I jokingly showed them a prototype: I took a photo of my cup and demonstrated how the system could instantly recognize its composition and calories. We laughed, but in that moment, a question took root: what if we built something like this on the scale of a person's entire life? Six months later, we launched our first version on the App Store, featuring a chat, food logging, and a memory function, eventually integrating heart rate and wearable data."

Параграф 2:
- "The true realization of our mission came after I moved to Europe and faced the reality of waiting weeks for a doctor's appointment. When I tried to find answers using ChatGPT, I hit the same wall every time: the AI remembered nothing from our previous conversations. I had to explain my symptoms and history all over again. It became obvious—the world needs an assistant with long-term memory that knows everything about you. We spent months experimenting with memory architecture, but the result was worth it: the more you interact with the system, the more deeply it understands you."

Параграф 3:
- "The turning point came when we spontaneously presented our work to doctors at the GavCure clinic in Israel. I never expected them to get "hooked" on the product so quickly. One doctor confessed to me that, thanks to the system, he was able to simply listen to a patient for the first time in five years, without being distracted by forms or typing. It gave me goosebumps. From that moment, growth exploded: we added FHIR medical standards for data transfer between clinics, implemented voice recording for appointments, and created pre-checkup systems that patients fill out while still on their way to the clinic. Looking back, we realized we had evolved from a simple tracker into a complete ecosystem of analytics and AI consultations. Now, when a patient enters the office, the doctor already knows everything about them, as if they've been acquainted for years. This is Healthy4U—and I feel like we're just getting warmed up."

## 3. OUR MISSION (Why we exist)

### Структура:
- Заголовок
- 4 параграфа + миссия

### Контент:

**Заголовок:**
- "Why we exist."

**Параграфы:**

Параграф 1:
- "**Healthcare today is reactive.** You get sick, visit a doctor, receive treatment, and disconnect until the next problem. This episodic model was designed for acute care — broken bones, infections, emergencies."

Параграф 2:
- "But **80% of healthcare costs come from chronic conditions** that require continuous monitoring, not episodic intervention. Diabetes doesn't care if you have an appointment next month. Heart disease doesn't pause between visits."

Параграф 3:
- "We believe healthcare should flow like conversation — continuous, adaptive, always listening. Patients shouldn't have to remember every symptom. Doctors shouldn't waste half their time typing. AI should connect the dots humans can't see."

**Миссия:**
- "Our mission: Make continuous care the default, not the exception."
